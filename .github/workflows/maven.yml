# This workflow will build a Java project with Maven, and cache/restore any dependencies to improve the workflow execution time
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-java-with-maven

# The implementation here just checks that the project is building successfully, so that any changes
# which break the build are caught before doing any harm.
# No tests are running - this will be done by Jenkins
